                    <p class="mb-30">JUST BEFORE he turned 20, Ranveer Singh found himself performing to a classroom packed with college students in the US. It was an acting class he had signed up for at Indiana University, and the professor had put them on the spot by asking everyone to present a piece. Ranveer, unprepared, walked up to the front of the class. It was the first time in years he was addressing a crowd. With sweaty palms but a steady breath, he rattled off the famous Amitabh Bachchan monologue from Deewaar (1975). Nobody understood a word, but the language barrier didn’t stop a hearty applause that still echoes in Ranveer’s mind. “I sat there stumped, and the claps continued. I remember it so vividly, almost as if it was in slow motion,” he says. That day changed everything.
                      Cut to a warm afternoon at a suburban five-star hotel in Mumbai 14 years later. Ranveer is yet to arrive but the energy in the room has already begun to shift. Two ice-cold espressos have been ordered, the room has been checked for the right temperature, an outdoor space has been assigned for the interview, and the path has been cleared. His spot boy informs his manager that he’s walking towards us. The drama, I’ve to admit, is amusing. Ranveer is famous for making epic public entries with his boom box blaring his hit songs, but that’s certainly not what was expected this afternoon. The 2018 Forbes India magazine that includes him among the top 10 Indian celebrities (in the company of Amitabh Bachchan and Sachin Tendulkar) lies casually on the coffee table in the room, and just as I flip its pages, I see him.
                      In black track pants, black jacket with his signature hoodie, sunglasses masking most of his face, and a slight smile, he says, “Hi ma’am, shall we start?” He’s mellower than usual today, not keen to draw attention. He still embodies his character Murad from Gully Boy. He takes a while to take off his sunglasses, and make eye contact. “I feel like it’s some kind of a weird security blanket,” he confesses.</p>
                    <p class="mb-30">Ranveer as Murad, the quiet introvert, the hip-hop music lover from Dharavi, who fights all odds, will be counted amongst the most exemplary and finessed characterisations in modern Indian cinema. There’s a Murad in every Indian home, who has hopes and aspirations that seem too audacious. And Ranveer’s embodiment of that persona, had us from frame one. He seethes slowly, there’s pain in his eyes, rebellion in his soul, and poetry in his words. “People think I’m this Bandra brat, but I am really among those kids as well. I grew up on the border of Bandra East and West, and literally shared a wall with them. On one hand, for me, were the affluent beings of this cosmopolitan suburb, but on the other was my time spent playing cricket and football with the boys from the waadi (neighbourhood).” Ranveer isn’t outwardly political, but he insists he isn’t far removed from Gully Boy’s social realities “I’d run back from school, throw my bag and rush to play a game with them. Their language, their conflicts, their fights with their own selves is something I witnessed very often. I’m not saying I related to their struggles entirely, but I wasn’t alien to them. My view for 25 years was fancy skyscrapers at one end, and the slums at the other. I was very aware of the duality of Mumbai, and that gave me a very interesting vantage point to the film,” he says calling himself a ‘true-blue Mumbai boy’.
                      Without a doubt his most understated performance, Zoya Akhtar’s Gully Boy establishes a new reality. Thirty-three- year-old Ranveer, who debuted just nine years ago and was almost written-off as too brash to be in Bollywood, is the superstar of his generation. With no hits to their name in the last year, the era of the Khans might finally be coming to an end. And their successor has both the appeal and charm of a hero, and the skill and submission of a great actor. He is not trying to imitate anyone, but is stitched from his own cloth. Someone who is standing on a pedestal, and still has his feet on the ground. “He’s an actor- star and since Aamir Khan I don’t think we’ve had someone who can do both, carry the might of a star and still maintain the honesty of being a fine actor,” says director Maneesh Verma who introduced him to the world with Band Baaja Baaraat (2010). “I don’t know about taglines, but what I do know is that this, what is happening to me, is beyond my wildest imagination,” Ranveer says.</p>
                    <blockquote>“I was just a kid with a dream and it came true. I understand that I am fortunate to be in this position- So when somebody expresses love or excitement- I take it in and I try and give back threefold. That’s just how I am,” says Ranveer Singh</blockquote>
                    <p class="mb-30">In the same note, his directors and co- actors see him as someone who’s fearless and doesn’t strive for perfection. His co- actor Vijay Varma, who plays his friend the carjacker Moeen, says, “Ranveer exudes a certain kind of self-worth and confidence that can’t be shaken by external factors. I truly believe that being a secure actor is something everyone should strive for and it shouldn’t be glorified. But Ranveer, in his system has a thing of giving, a lot. I remember during a workshop I was having trouble with my character and he just ran his palm on my back. Asked me to breathe. It was where I connected with him. That makes the experience so real, and so memorable.” Zoya Akhar, who is a friend and has also directed him in Dil Dhadakne Do (2015), adds, “He’s fine being vulnerable. He’s very mindful and knows when to step back. You don’t see Ranveer, but Murad the minute he’s on screen, and that’s because he’s so invested in his part. He’s okay to not take the spotlight in a scene, and aims to serve the story in the end, and that’s a precious quality for an actor.”</p>
